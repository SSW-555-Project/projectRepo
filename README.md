# SSW-555 Project Log 
## 9/20
### Issue:
1. User Story 27 already implemented
->Chang to User Story 33
2. Why the code checking end with “—-“
-> This line of code is used to determine whether the input line is “NOTE” or not
3. Datetime.datetime.strptime()
-> This method do offer a much quicker way to implement date string, but in order to calculate age, maybe the original way is okay.
4. Remove .zip file for better collaboration
-> Done
5. GitHub branch_merge_pull request strategy
-> Working on this issue.
